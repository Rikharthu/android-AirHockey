    <string name = "description_vertex_shader">
        A vertex shader generates the final position of each vertex and is run once per vertex.
        Once the final positions are known, OpenGL will take the visible set of vertices and assemble
        them into points, lines, and triangles

    </string><string name = "description_fragment_shader">
        A fragment shader generates the final color of each fragment of a point,
        line, or triangle and is run once per fragment. A fragment is a small,
        rectangular area of a single color, analogous to a pixel on a computer
        screen.
